- eliminate odd mutable datastructures: irrelevant for performance, and the cost of clear semantics;

- import_theory_by_name: support stack of sessions, no longer restrict to Pure as parent;

- clarify OfClass proofs (normally expanded by Isabelle);

- clarify Oracle proofs (normally expanded by Isabelle);

- clarify implicit conversion (alpha, beta, but also eta?!?);
